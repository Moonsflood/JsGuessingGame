JsGuessingGame

Java Script Guessing Game!!

Guess a number from 1-20

You will lose a point if you guess the incorrect number and the program will let you know if your guess is too high or too low.

The program will also not take 0 and let you know that it is not a number for the game.

Once you guess the correct number, you will get a green screen.

For your first run, the score you get will be recorded as the highest score.

You can then click on "again" to restart the game and try to best your highest score.
